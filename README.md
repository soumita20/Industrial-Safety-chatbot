# Multi-Label Text Classification Using NLP

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a multi-label text classification pipeline using Stack Overflow question data. It focuses on applying classical NLP techniques and machine learning models to extract meaningful insights and classify questions into appropriate tags.

## üîç Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify questions into multiple relevant tags based on their textual content. Key steps include:

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on tag frequency and text length
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Multi-label classification using machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) and deep learning models (LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM)
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score
- Hyperparameter tuning
